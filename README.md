CRAN, a clone of R repo


This is a standalone project that stores and processes 
R package requests. 

There are 4 main components of this project:
1. Home page, that shows a list of all packages
2. Search page, shows the list of packages by package name
3. Download link to download the given package (Need to go to the overview page for it)
4. Upload, this allows new packages to be uploaded  and there is a parser engine behind the scenes, 
that would help populatee the metadata into the DB

please use the startup script provided to run the code
This would require MySQL DB installed on the local machine
